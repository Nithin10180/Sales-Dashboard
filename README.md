# Sales-Dashboard

📌 About the Project
This project focuses on building an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize business performance based on the SuperStore Sales dataset. The goal of the project is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that help understand sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and regional performance.
The dataset contains detailed records of customer orders, including order date, shipping details, product categories and sub-categories, sales amount, profit, discount, quantity, customer segment, and geographic regions. Using Power BI, this data is modeled, analyzed, and visualized to support data-driven decision-making.

🔄 Data Preparation & Modeling
The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing using Power Query. Tasks include:
•	Handling missing and inconsistent values
•	Converting data types (dates, numbers, categories)
•	Creating calculated columns for time-based analysis
•	Building relationships between tables for accurate aggregation
A proper data model is designed to ensure efficient reporting and performance.

📐 DAX & Measures
To derive meaningful KPIs, multiple DAX measures are created, such as:
•	Total Sales
•	Total Profit
•	Profit Margin
•	Number of Orders
•	Average Order Value
•	Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales
•	Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth
•	Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison
These measures allow dynamic analysis across different filters and slicers.
